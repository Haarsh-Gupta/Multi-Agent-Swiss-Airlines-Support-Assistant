      "\t* If the fare condition allows it, it is possible to make multiple changes to the itinerary.\n",
      "6. Can a name be changed after a booking is made?\n",
      "\t* The correct name(s) of the customer travelling need to be entered in a booking. The first and last name of the passenger travelling needs to be entered exactly as in the travel documents. Entering a middle name is optional and can be added in the first name field. However, there is a character limitation for this field.\n",
      "\t* Your first and middle name is stored by the system spelled together without spaces. This is not a mistake and does not affect your booking.\n",

      "8. Until what time before departure can a flight be rebooked online?\n",

      "What exactly does the ID scan check and where does this take place?\n",
      "The ID scan and comparison with a selfie prevents fraud and ensures that the person who booked the flight is the actual invoice recipient and that there has been no identity theft. For this purpose, you will receive a link via text message to your smartphone. You will be able to upload your documents and identify yourself via this link.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I have to carry out the ID scan for every booking?\n",
      "No, once you have successfully completed the ID scan, you will not have to do it again for a later booking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why has my ID scan failed?\n",
      "Please note the following when carrying out an ID scan: The photographs should be sharp, well-exposed and avoid reflections. Do not cover the documents. Take a recent photograph of yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I repeat a failed ID scan?\n",
      "Yes, if your documents were not recognised, you may repeat the ID scan.\n",
      "\n",
      "What reasons could there be for not authorising the \"Pay per invoice\" option?\n",
      "For \"Pay per invoice\", our partner POWERPAY carries out an online check. This check may have a negative outcome for a variety of reasons, such as creditworthiness, contradictory information or unpaid POWERPAY invoices. You can find more detailed information about these reasons on the ​POWERPAY website.\n",
      "\n",
      "How and when will I receive the POWERPAY invoice?\n",
      "Invoices are issued by POWERPAY. You will receive an individual invoice by e-mail after about 24–48 hours. This invoice is issued free of charge. When the individual invoice is paid on time, no charges are incurred. After this, the amounts outstanding from the individual invoices you have already received will be summarised into one account statement. You will receive this statement by post in the form of a monthly invoice approximately in the middle of the following month, together with a paying-in slip. The cost for issuing the monthly invoice is CHF 2.90.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long is the payment period and how much are the reminder fees for non-payment?\n",
      "Individual invoice: The invoice must be paid within 15 days of receipt of the e-mail. Payment will be processed via online banking. Payments made at the post office counter incur third-party costs.\n",
      "Monthly invoice: The deadline for payment is always the end of the month with the paying-in slip.\n",
      "Is partial payment possible?\n",
      "Yes, partial payment is possible for both the individual and the monthly invoices. You can decide to pay between 10% and 100% of the total amount due.\n",
      "\n",
      "When does a reminder fee become due and how much does it cost?\n",
      "If the minimum payment of the monthly invoice is made late, POWERPAY charges a reminder fee of CHF 15 for the first reminder and CHF 25 for the second reminder.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I get a refund if I cancel my ticket?\n",
      "This depends on when you make the cancellation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the invoice has already been paid, you will receive the corresponding refund by bank transfer.\n",
      "If SWISS is able to inform POWERPAY of the cancellation before the end of the payment period and if the invoice has not been paid or has only been partially paid, POWERPAY will send you a new individual invoice with the new amount and the new payment period if there is still an amount pending.\n",
      "If SWISS is only able to inform POWERPAY once the end of the payment period has been reached, and if the invoice has not been paid or only partially paid, the MF Group will send you a monthly invoice with the additional costs of CHF 2.90 minus the amount to be refunded.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do I have to pay the invoice in full before boarding my flight?\n",
      "No, you can board your flight regardless of whether you have paid your POWERPAY invoice or not.\n",

      "You decide which currency is to be charged to your credit card.\n",
      "The daily exchange rate is displayed, and is guaranteed for the payment.\n",

      "\n",
      "What exchange rate is used for the conversion?\n",
      "The total converted amount is based on the daily exchange rates of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). Please note that the exchange range can therefore vary for new bookings or booking enquiries made through swiss.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exchange rate at the time the booking is concluded is definitive. It will appear both on swiss.com and on the confirmation.\n",

Furthermore, this payment option is only available for flights from Switzerland.\\n\\nWhat exactly does the ID scan check and where does this take place?\\nThe ID scan and comparison with a selfie prevents fraud and ensures that the person who booked the flight is the actual invoice recipient and that there has been no identity theft. For this purpose, you will receive a link via text message to your smartphone. You will be able to upload your documents and identify yourself via this link.\\n\\nDo I have to carry out the ID scan for every booking?\\nNo, once you have successfully completed the ID scan, you will not have to do it again for a later booking.\\n\\nWhy has my ID scan failed?\\nPlease note the following when carrying out an ID scan: The photographs should be sharp, well-exposed and avoid reflections. Do not cover the documents. Take a recent photograph of yourself.\\n\\nCan I repeat a failed ID scan?\\nYes, if your documents were not recognised, you may repeat the ID scan.\\n\\nWhat reasons could there be for not authorising the \"Pay per invoice\" option?\\nFor \"Pay per invoice\", our partner POWERPAY carries out an online check. This check may have a negative outcome for a variety of reasons, such as creditworthiness, contradictory information or unpaid POWERPAY invoices. You can find more detailed information about these reasons on the \\u200bPOWERPAY website.\\n\\nHow and when will I receive the POWERPAY invoice?\\nInvoices are issued by POWERPAY. You will receive an individual invoice by e-mail after about 24–48 hours. This invoice is issued free of charge. When the individual invoice is paid on time, no charges are incurred. After this, the amounts outstanding from the individual invoices you have already received will be summarised into one account statement. You will receive this statement by post in the form of a monthly invoice approximately in the middle of the following month, together with a paying-in slip. The cost for issuing the monthly invoice is CHF 2.90.\\n\\nHow long is the payment period and how much are the reminder fees for non-payment?\\nIndividual invoice: The invoice must be paid within 15 days of receipt of the e-mail. Payment will be processed via online banking. Payments made at the post office counter incur third-party costs.\\nMonthly invoice: The deadline for payment is always the end of the month with the paying-in slip.\\nIs partial payment possible?\\nYes, partial payment is possible for both the individual and the monthly invoices. You can decide to pay between 10% and 100% of the total amount due.\\n\\nWhen does a reminder fee become due and how much does it cost?\\nIf the minimum payment of the monthly invoice is made late, POWERPAY charges a reminder fee of CHF 15 for the first reminder and CHF 25 for the second reminder.\\n\\nHow do I get a refund if I cancel my ticket?\\nThis depends on when you make the cancellation.\\n\\nIf the invoice has already been paid, you will receive the corresponding refund by bank transfer.\\nIf SWISS is able to inform POWERPAY of the cancellation before the end of the payment period and if the invoice has not been paid or has only been partially paid, POWERPAY will send you a new individual invoice with the new amount and the new payment period if there is still an amount pending.\\nIf SWISS is only able to inform POWERPAY once the end of the payment period has been reached, and if the invoice has not been paid or only partially paid, the MF Group will send you a monthly invoice with the additional costs of CHF 2.90 minus the amount to be refunded.\\n \\n\\nDo I have to pay the invoice in full before boarding my flight?\\nNo, you can board your flight regardless of whether you have paid your POWERPAY invoice or not.\\n\\nDo you have any queries about your invoice?\\nIf you have any queries about invoices, please contact POWERPAY’s customer service.\\n\\nE-mail: info@powerpay.ch\\n\\nHotline: +41 58 806 06 22\\n\\nCustomer service is available Mondays to Fridays from 8:00 to 17:00 h.\\n\\nCan I give my business address for payments?\\nPurchases on account can only be made on submission of your private address.\\n\\n'},\n",

This does not apply if you pay in the currency of your credit card.\\n \\n\\nWho can benefit from the currency conversion option?\\nThe option to pay in a different currency is available only when booking through swiss.com.\\n\\nThe service cannot be used to change flights, for later upgrades or additional services (e.g. additional baggage item etc.) or for ticket purchases made through different booking channels. These are charged in the original currency of the departure airport.\\n\\nWhat exchange rate is used for the conversion?\\nThe total converted amount is based on the daily exchange rates of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). Please note that the exchange range can therefore vary for new bookings or booking enquiries made through swiss.com.\\n\\nThe exchange rate at the time the booking is concluded is definitive. It will appear both on swiss.com and on the confirmation.\\n\\nWill there be any other credit card charges?\\nSome banks might charge additional fees in individual cases.

What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?\\nThe fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\\n\\nWhy doesn\\'t SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\\nGroup bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\\n\\nCan the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\\nThe additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\\n\\nIs it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?\\nWenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.\\n\\nWhat do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?\\nTarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.\\n\\nWhat do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?\\nIm Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.\\n\\nWhat are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?\\nThe number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\\n\\nIf I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\\nLike the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\\n\\nIf I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\\nNo; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\\nThe 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\\n\\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\\nThe first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.\\n\\nIf I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?\\nNo; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.\\n\\nHow many additional items of baggage can I purchase?\\nYou can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.\\n\\nSWISS Economy Flex: what does the “Change to earlier flight on the same day” service offer?\\nApplies to \"Economy Flex\" and \"Business Flex\" fares.

      "\t* The correct name(s) of the customer travelling need to be entered in a booking. The first and last name of the passenger travelling needs to be entered exactly as in the travel documents. Entering a middle name is optional and can be added in the first name field. However, there is a character limitation for this field.\n",

      "\t* The changes processed on swiss.com are limited to the flight booking only. No changes to any other service included in your package (e.g. hotel, rental car etc.) will be processed.\n",
      "19. I want to process an online change to a flight booking which was purchased with a Travel Agency. What do I need to consider?\n",

      "## Frequently asked questions: European fare concept\n",
      "Can a particular Economy fare be fully booked?\n",
      "No. As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .\n",
      "\n",
      "Can the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?\n",
      "The fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why doesn't SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\n",
      "Group bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\n",
      "The additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?\n",
      "Wenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?\n",
      "Tarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?\n",
      "Im Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?\n",
      "The number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\n",
      "Like the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\n",
      "No; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\n",
      "The 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\n",
      "The first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?\n",
      "No; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many additional items of baggage can I purchase?\n",
      "You can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "SWISS Economy Flex: what does the “Change to earlier flight on the same day” service offer?\n",
      "Applies to \"Economy Flex\" and \"Business Flex\" fares. Rebooking free of charge is possible only on the day of departure during online check-in via lufthansa.com or the Lufthansa app, or at a check-in machine or check-in counter at the airport. Applies to direct flights only. A change of route or airline is not possible.\n",
